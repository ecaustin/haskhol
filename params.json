This logic is essentially a confluence of Wiedijk and Voelker's logics, with a subtle modification to the stateless approach to embed hashes for comparison, rather than definitional values.  This allows HaskHOL to efficiently represent and operate over its primitive data types, even in the presence of non-lazy traversals.  As a brief aside, the current reliance on hashes is potentially unsound, however, that should be fixed by moving to static keys as provided by the static pointers implementation coming soon to GHC.\r\n\r\nThe stateful features of the HaskHOL system are built on top of this kernel by simulating the desired side effects via a computational monad.  We find this segregation to be beneficial, as the implementation of the side effects does not need to worry about maintaining the soundness of the system, provided that the interface exposed by the kernel is respected.\r\nThe [haskhol-core](https://github.com/ecaustin/haskhol-core) package provides the kernel, stateful layer, and other basic functionality (parser, pretty-printer, etc.) of HaskHOL.\r\nAdditional packages providing more advanced libraries are in an experimental, semi-stable state, but should be made publicly available soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current focus of the HaskHOL project is developing a linkage with GHC at the compiler plugin level for the purpose of verifying Haskell code natively at compile time.\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n\r\nThe Core HaskHOL system is now publicly available on Hackage.\r\nProvided you have an up to date Haskell and Cabal installation, installing HaskHOL-Core should be as easy as running the command: `cabal install haskhol-core`\r\n\r\nAdditional libraries are available by request.\r\nThey will be released publicly, pending a code review and documentation.\r\n\r\nA basic tutorial is in the works, but its availability is currently unknown.\r\nIn the mean time, we encourage you to consult the documentation of the previously mentioned systems, and Gordon and Melham's *Introduction to HOL*, to answer any HOL questions you may have.\r\n\r\n# Papers\r\n\r\nThe best description of the primitive logic behind HaskHOL is contained within our submission to ITP2013, Stateless Higher-Order Logic with Quantified Types: [HaskHOL ITP 2013](http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~eaustin/papers/haskhol_itp2013.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
